# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Display employee names instead of employee codes in the holiday and permission approval views.

**Planned changes:**
- Replace employee code display with full employee names in the HolidayApprovals component
- Replace employee code display with full employee names in the PermissionApprovals component
- Fetch user profiles to retrieve employee names for all requests shown in approval views

**User-visible outcome:** Managers reviewing holiday and permission requests will see employee names instead of cryptic employee codes, making it easier to identify who submitted each request.
