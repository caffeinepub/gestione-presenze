# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Enable admin invites, display user names in team overview, and show invite creation timestamps.

**Planned changes:**
- Add role selector (user/admin) to invite generation interface
- Store and display creation date/time for each invite link
- Show user names instead of identity codes in Team Overview and CSV exports
- Backend support for admin role assignment via invite codes

**User-visible outcome:** Administrators can create invite links for both regular users and new admins, see when each invite was created, and view team members by name in the Team Overview for compliance purposes.
